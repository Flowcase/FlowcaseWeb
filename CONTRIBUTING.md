# Contributing to Flowcase

üëã First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâ

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Flowcase, which is hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Flowcase. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report üìù, reproduce the behavior üíª, and find related reports üîé.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](https://github.com/Flowcase/FlowcaseWeb/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Flowcase/FlowcaseWeb/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

1. **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
2. **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
3. **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
4. **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
5. **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
6. **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Flowcase's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for Flowcase's maintainers to review contributions

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
- Reference developers and companies appropriately.
- Update the `README.md` with any changes that are relevant to the project.
